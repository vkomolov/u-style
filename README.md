# Gulp 4 Front-End package "gulp": "^4.0.0"
Task: to compile the npm plugins in production of HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and IMAGES files.

## Feature:
- It compiles and minimizes JS files, using "Browserify" 
in combination with "Watchify", "Babelify" and "Uglify" plugins;
**All JS files in the target source path will be separately bundled, browserified, babelified and uglified; 
The destination path will consist file.js.map, file.js and file.min.js; 
!!All inner folders of the source path should contain only supporting
JS files, which are exported to the main JS files, located in the target
source path. The "build" JS destination will contain only main JS files bundled**

- It minimizes HTML files;
- It compiles and minimizes SCSS files;
**!!All inner SCSS folders of the main source path should contain only
supporting SCSS files, which are exported to the main SCSS files, located
in the main source path. The "build" CSS destination will contain only
main CSS files with relations bundled.**

- it compresses the image files with special rules for
the each type of the image file;


### Getting Started:
- just clone the rep, then run 'npm install' for dependencies;

- 'gulp watch': please, init in the console for the single build of
the target files, starting Browser and following watching of the
files to be changed; 
- 'gulp build': please, init in the console for the single build of
the target files and starting Browser. The following changes of the 
target files will not be checked;

### Instructions

- The Browser Reloading is realized with "browser-sync": "^2.26.3"

#### HTML: 

Each HTML file, located in 'src/' will be minimized and piped to 'build/';
##### Plugins:
###### "gulp-filesize": "0.0.6" 
- to log the sizes of the files before and after minimizing;

###### "gulp-htmlmin": "^5.0.1" 
- to minimize *.html with white space collapsing;

#### CSS: 

Each scss file, located in 'src/scss' (except inner
directories), will be piped to 'build/css' as minimized 
file (with 'min' prefix) and not minimized version
for convenience; The minimized version of css file will
be linked in html page;
##### Plugins:
###### "gulp-filesize": "0.0.6" 
- to log the sizes of the files before and after minimizing;

###### "gulp-sass": "^4.0.2"
- to compile .scss files to css;

###### "gulp-autoprefixer": "^6.0.0"
to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules;

###### "gulp-rename": "^1.4.0"
- to rename the file in stream and passing further;

###### "gulp-clean-css": "^4.0.0"
- to minify CSS file;

###### "gulp-filesize": "0.0.6" 
- to log the sizes of the files before and after minimizing;

#### JS:

Each js file, located in 'src/js' (except inner
directories), will be piped to 'build/js' as minimized 
file (with 'min' prefix) and not minimized version
for convenience; The minimized version of js file can
be linked in html page;
##### Plugins:
###### node-js path
will be required for path.basename property;

###### "browserify": "^16.2.3"
- to require module.exports from the separate js files;
It gives convenience in importing files as in node.js
by using 'require';
- browserify will recursively analyze all the require()
 calls in the app in order to build a bundle, which can
 be served up to the browser in a single <script> tag.
 
###### "babelify": "^10.0.0"
###### "@babel/core": "^7.3.4"
###### "@babel/preset-env": "^7.3.4"
- works in combination with "browserify", converting 
ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version 
of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments;

###### "watchify": "^3.11.1"
- works in combination with "browserify", watching for
the changes, then the "browserify" bundle will be recompiled;

###### "gulp-watch": "^5.0.1"
- is used for watching the files in the target path, then
the callback function repipes the files to the 'build' path;

###### "exorcist": "^1.0.1"
- is used in combination with "browserify" to create 
separate map.js files in the pipe;

###### "vinyl-buffer": "^1.0.1"
###### "vinyl-source-stream": "^2.0.0"
- Convert streaming vinyl files to use buffers.
"vinyl-source-stream" module is just a bridge that makes it simple to 
use conventional text streams such as this in combination 
with gulp.

###### "gulp-uglify": "^3.0.2"
- Uglifying JavaScript involves changing variable and 
function names to reduce their size;

#### IMAGES:

Each image file, located in 'src/img', will be piped to 'build/img' 
as minimized file

###### "gulp-newer": "^1.4.0"
- to check the 'build' directory and to pipe the images 
from 'src/img' only if a new file exists;

###### "gulp-imagemin": "^5.0.3"
- to compress the image files, corresponding to the rules 
for compressing: gif, jpeg, png and svg files;
